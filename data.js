Businesses approach\nR&D in different ways, with different organisations implementing different R&D strategies & techniques. The\nway R&D is leveraged inside an organisation also varies significantly between business streams or Departments,\nhaving a considerable importance in terms of its overall impact. When developing a new product, process or\nservice, or optimizing an existing one, R&D can be considered as one of the earliest phases. R&D cycle generally\nbegins with generation of ideas (ideation) & theoretical explanation of concepts, followed by research, & then\ndevelopment. In India, CPSEs, especially those in the power, petroleum, defence, mining & steel sectors, have long\nplayed a leading role in R&D. While a number of CPSEs have in-house R&D facilities, others have opted for\nsponsored research via collaborations with universities & reputed R&D institutions.\nOver the years, CPSEs have been focusing on investing in R&D activities, resulting in innovative and cost-\nsaving technologies, products, services, etc. The total R&D Expenditure has increased from ₹7,715 crores\nduring FY 2023-24 to ₹9,691 crores in FY 2024-25 recorded 25.62% growth over the period.\n4.2 Cognate group-wise expenditure on R&D\nThe detailed industries wise & group-wise statement, indicating the expenditure on R&D in absolute terms\nis given in Table 4.1.\nTable 4.1: Cognate group wise expenditure on R&D from FY 2022-23 to 2024-25 ( ₹ in Crores).\n2024-25 2023-24 2022-23\nDefence Production \t4,684 3,303 2,896\nPetroleum (Refinery & Marketing) \t1,492 1,497 1,188\nHeavy & Medium Engineering \t750 768 748\nCrude Oil \t627 628 728\nPower Generation \t588 383 350\nTransport And Logistic Services \t472 335 270\nPower Transmission \t314 220 29\nSteel \t245 253 414\nCoal \t221 9 132\nOther Minerals & Metals \t162 216 389\nContract & Construction and Tech.

Under this, CPSEs undertake to achieve targets set in the MoU normally\nat the beginning of the year. In MoU evaluation, the performance of CPSEs on selected parameters is\ncompared with the determined targets. The inclusion of a MoU helps make 'management' of the enterprise\naccountable to the government.\n6.1.2 Scope : All CPSEs (Holding as well as Subsidiaries) are required to sign a MoU annually. The\nholding CPSEs sign the MoU with their Administrative Ministries/ Departments, while the subsidiaries sign\nthe MoU with their respective holding companies. The table below depicts year-wise data of MoU signed\nover the previous year. The number of MoU signing CPSEs has decreased over the period due to various\nreasons such as the closure of CPSEs, merging of the subsidiaries with holding companies and their MoU on\nconsolidated basis, exemption from signing of MoU for sick/ under closure/ under-construction/ non-\noperational CPSEs or other grounds as per the recommendation from the Administrative Ministry.\nTable 6.1 Details of MoU signing\nYear MoU signed Year MoU signed\n1987-88 4 2012-13 196\n1991-92 72 2013-14 197\n2001-02 104 2014-15 214\n2002-03 100 2015-16 215\n2003-04 96 2016-17 231\n2004-05 99 2017-18 196\n2005-06 102 2018-19 165\n2006-07 113 2019-20 144\n2007-08 144 2020-21 124\n2008-09 147 2021-22 107\n2009-10 197 2022-23 88\n2010-11 198 2023-24 91\n2011-12 97 2024-25 90\n2025-26 86\n\n-- 151 of 416 --\n\nPublic Enterprises Survey 2024-25\t Public Enterprises Survey 2024-25 138\n6.1.3 Institutional arrangements for implementation of MoU Policy :\na) High Powered Committee (HPC): The High Powered Committee is the Apex body under MoU\nsystem for laying policy guidelines. HPC is headed by the Cabinet Secretary and comprises following\nmembers : CEO (NITI Aayog), Finance Secretary, Secretary (Expenditure), Secretary (Statistics &\nProgramme Implementation), Chairman (Public Enterprises Selection Board), Chief Economic Advisor\n(Economic Affairs) and Secretary (DPE).\n(b) Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC): The IMC finalise the sectoral template/ CPSE wise MoU\nparameters. The purpose of sectoral templates is to select and identify the parameters and weightages\nrelevant to the core business activities in that sector and or CPSE. IMC will also set the requisite levels of\nperformance against each of the parameters, so decided, as benchmarked targets. The IMC comprises\nSecretary (DPE) as Chairman, Representatives of Chief Economic Advisor (Department of Economic\nAffairs), Department of Expenditure, MoSPI, NITI Aayog and Secretary/ representative of Administrative\nMinistry as special invitee and any other expert co-opted on need basis.\n6.1.4 MoU Framework (FY 2021-22 & onwards): The framework for MoU System using an online\ndashboard for the target setting and performance evaluation of CPSEs has been put in place and made\napplicable from FY 2021-22 & onwards. The parameters included in the revised MoU process are market\noriented, reflecting the shareholders' interest in terms of growth in revenue, EBITDA margin, return on net\nworth, return on capital employed, asset turnover ratio, and market capitalization. Adequate weightage has\nalso been given to production linked parameters pertaining to CPSE's core operations. All the parameters\nare quantifiable and verifiable from the documents in public domain. Besides, certain government's\npriorities/ programmes such as procurement from MSEs, CSR, etc. have also been included for compliance\nby CPSEs, the non-compliance of which would result in deduction of marks.

The objective of the policy is promotion and development of MSEs by supporting them in marketing\nof products & services. Some key points related to the policy include:\nI. With effect from FY 2012-13, every CPSE & Central Govt. Department should set an annual goal\nfor procurement from the MSE sector at the beginning of the year, with the objective of achieving an\noverall procurement goal of minimum 20% of total annual purchases of products produced &\nservices rendered by MSEs from the latter in a period of three years.\nII. Of the 20% target of annual procurement from MSEs, a sub-target of 4% must be earmarked for\nprocurement from MSEs owned by SC/ST entrepreneurs. However, in the event of failure of such\nMSEs to participate in the tender process or meet the tender requirements & the L1 price, the sub-\ntarget of 4% an be met from other MSEs.\nIII. At the end of three years (i.e., from FY 2015-16) the overall procurement goal of minimum 20% was\nmade mandatory. Non- conforming departments were required to provide reasons for the same to\nthe review committee set up under the policy.\n\n-- 167 of 416 --\n\nPublic Enterprises Survey 2024-25\t Public Enterprises Survey 2024-25 154\nIV. In a tender, participating MSEs quoting price within the band of L1+15% may also be allowed to\nsupply a portion of the requirement by lowering their price to the L1 price in a situation where the L1\nprice is from someone other than an MSE. Such MSEs may be allowed to supply 20% of the total\ntendered value. In case of more than one such eligible MSE, the supply would be shared equally.\nThe Central Government amended the policy to increase the minimum annual procurement from MSEs\nfrom 20% to 25% and also mandated procuring minimum 3% out of the 25% from MSEs owned by women,\nin addition to 4% to be procured from MSEs owned by SC/ ST entrepreneurs. Further, to reduce transaction\ncost of doing business, MSEs were supported by providing tender sets free of cost and exempting them from\npayment of earnest money. These amendments were effected from April 1, 2019.\n199 CPSEs reported a total procurement from MSEs amounting to ₹98,064 crore during FY 2024-25, which\nshows an increase of 26.8% over previous year.\nCognate Group-wise Procurement from MSEs for FY 2024-25 is given in Table 7.3.

It is a dynamic, self-sustaining & user- friendly portal for procurement by offices of various\nGovernment Ministries & Departments, CPSEs & autonomous bodies of the Central Government.\nDGS&D developed GeM with technical support of National e-Governance Division (Ministry of\nElectronics & Information Technology). Intended benefits of the portal are listed below:\nI. Transparency: GeM eliminates human interface in vendor registration, order placement, &\npayment processing to a great extent. Being an open platform, it offers no entry barriers to bona fide\nsuppliers who wish to conduct business with the Government. At every step SMS & e-mail\nnotifications are sent to the buyers, the heads of their organisations, paying authorities & sellers.\nII. Efficiency: Direct purchase on GeM can be done within minutes and the entire process is online &\nend-to-end integrated with online tools for assessing price reasonability. For procurement of higher-\nvalue products & services, a transparent & efficient bidding / Reverse Auction (RA) facility is\navailable on GeM. For creating a bid / RA, buyers do not need to enter their own technical\nspecifications as they have been standardised on GeM. The bid / RA can be created expeditiously &\nfinalised within minimum of seven days.\nIII. Security & Safety: GeM is a secure platform & all the documents on the portal are e-signed at\nvarious stages by buyers & sellers. The antecedents of suppliers are verified online & automatically\nthrough MCA21, Aadhaar & PAN databases. Furthermore, third-party assessment of suppliers is\nconducted by Securities & Exchange Board of India-empanelled credit rating agencies.\nIV. Savings: The transparency, efficiency & ease of use of GeM has resulted in a substantial reduction in\nprices on the portal compared with the tender, rate contract & direct purchase rates. Average prices\non GeM are lower by at least 15-20% & insome cases even up to 56%. GeM also carries out demand\naggregation for items to be procured by various Central/State Government departments.\nV. Inclusivity in the Business Value Chain: Prosperity of the MSE sector is crucial for the growth of\nour country. The sector fuels the economy by providing employment & income to millions of people\nwho work for small, local businesses as well as in start-ups. GeM expects to improve the ease of\ndoing business for such small & medium enterprises and provide inclusivity by giving them a fair &\ntransparent platform to participate in business activities generated from Government sources.\nThe cognate group wise data showing total procurement, annual procurement through GeM & annual\nprocurement from MSEs through GeM during FY 2024-25 is summarised in Table 7.4.\n\n-- 169 of 416 --\n\nPublic Enterprises Survey 2024-25\t Public Enterprises Survey 2024-25 156\nTable 7.4: Procurement through GeM in FY 2024-25 (₹ lakh)\nS.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting is about disclosures by an organisation on non-\nfinancial parameters on aspects like ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and Business\nSustainability. In India, SEBI has introduced new reporting requirement called the Business Responsibility and\nSustainability Report (BRSR) applicable on select listed Companies based on Market Capitalisation. This also\ncovers few listed CPSEs based on Market Capitalisation. SEBI's BRSR format covers most of the ESG\nParameters. The BRSR disclosed by such CPSE for 2024-25 were collected. An attempt has been to collate the\nmetrics of such CPSEs on select parameters. As per information submitted by CPSEs in PE Survey 2024-25,\nthe BRSR is disclosed by 55 CPSEs (14 Maharatna CPSE, 23 Navratna CPSEs and 18 Other CPSEs). The\ninformation on Employee Training on various subject like Green House Gas Emissions, Stakeholder\nengagements & Complaints, Gender issues, Governance, Energy, Emission monitoring and Responsible Waste\nManagement have been considered as relevant for the collation and exhibited in this chapter in the forthcoming\nparagraphs and tables. The complete BRSR are available on the website of the respective CPSE. For few\nparameters, DPE has collected information (like CSR spending, gender bifurcation, social classification of\nemployees like SC, ST and OBC) from all CPSEs, irrespective of applicability of BRSR. Accordingly for other\nselected parameters all CPSEs are covered having such parameters.\n8.2 Coverage of CPSEs\nunder BRSR\n8.2.1 BRSR Format is primarily\ndivided into three sections. Section\nA covers General Disclosures;\nSection B covers Management and\nProcess Disclosures; Section C\nc o v e r s t h e P r i n c i p l e w i s e\nPerformance Disclosures.

Since independence, CPSEs have played a unique role in the Indian\neconomy through their contribution towards industrial growth and infrastructure development and served\nas a vital extension of the Central Government in implementing critical development projects. The CPSEs\nalso generate employment opportunities and fulfill social responsibilities by implementing Government’s\nflagship programs and providing last mile connectivity and public utilities even in the hinterlands.\n1.2 Brief history of the Public Enterprises (PE) Survey\nThe Estimates Committee in its 73rd Report (2nd Lok Sabha) in FY 1959-60 recommended that in addition\nto the annual report of each enterprise submitted on the Table of both Houses of Parliament, there should be\na separate detailed report highlighting the performance of CPSEs. The Bureau of Public Enterprises (now\nDepartment of Public Enterprises) under the Ministry of Finance drafted the first Public Enterprises Survey\nin FY 1960-61. This report depicted the working of all the CPSEs using key financial and operational\nparameters.\n1.3 Overview of CPSEs\nMost CPSEs were set up after independence when the private sector was neither forthcoming nor had the\ncapacity for large capital-intensive enterprises. There were only five CPSEs in 1951 but by 1969, the\nnumber grew to 84. The number of CPSEs trebled to 260 in FY 2011-12, and increased to 475 in FY 2024-\n25. The trend in total number of CPSEs over the last five years along with number of listed CPSEs has been\nprovided in Table 1.1.\nTable 1.1: Trend in number of CPSEs.\n#As per Tariff based Competititve Bidding (TBCB) guidleines, CPSEs are incorporated by Bid Processor Coordinator (BPC) of Ministry of\nPower for each transmission project as a Special Pupose Vehicle (SPVs).

Businesses approach\nR&D in different ways, with different organisations implementing different R&D strategies & techniques. The\nway R&D is leveraged inside an organisation also varies significantly between business streams or Departments,\nhaving a considerable importance in terms of its overall impact. When developing a new product, process or\nservice, or optimizing an existing one, R&D can be considered as one of the earliest phases. R&D cycle generally\nbegins with generation of ideas (ideation) & theoretical explanation of concepts, followed by research, & then\ndevelopment. In India, CPSEs, especially those in the power, petroleum, defence, mining & steel sectors, have long\nplayed a leading role in R&D. While a number of CPSEs have in-house R&D facilities, others have opted for\nsponsored research via collaborations with universities & reputed R&D institutions.\nOver the years, CPSEs have been focusing on investing in R&D activities, resulting in innovative and cost-\nsaving technologies, products, services, etc. The total R&D Expenditure has increased from ₹7,715 crores\nduring FY 2023-24 to ₹9,691 crores in FY 2024-25 recorded 25.62% growth over the period.\n4.2 Cognate group-wise expenditure on R&D\nThe detailed industries wise & group-wise statement, indicating the expenditure on R&D in absolute terms\nis given in Table 4.1.\nTable 4.1: Cognate group wise expenditure on R&D from FY 2022-23 to 2024-25 ( ₹ in Crores).\n2024-25 2023-24 2022-23\nDefence Production 4,684 3,303 2,896\nPetroleum (Refinery & Marketing) 1,492 1,497 1,188\nHeavy & Medium Engineering 750 768 748\nCrude Oil 627 628 728\nPower Generation 588 383 350\nTransport And Logistic Services 472 335 270\nPower Transmission 314 220 29\nSteel 245 253 414\nCoal 221 9 132\nOther Minerals & Metals 162 216 389\nContract & Construction and Tech.

In MoU evaluation, the performance of CPSEs on selected parameters is\ncompared with the determined targets. The inclusion of a MoU helps make 'management' of the enterprise\naccountable to the government.\n6.1.2 Scope : All CPSEs (Holding as well as Subsidiaries) are required to sign a MoU annually. The\nholding CPSEs sign the MoU with their Administrative Ministries/ Departments, while the subsidiaries sign\nthe MoU with their respective holding companies. The table below depicts year-wise data of MoU signed\nover the previous year. The number of MoU signing CPSEs has decreased over the period due to various\nreasons such as the closure of CPSEs, merging of the subsidiaries with holding companies and their MoU on\nconsolidated basis, exemption from signing of MoU for sick/ under closure/ under-construction/ non-\noperational CPSEs or other grounds as per the recommendation from the Administrative Ministry.\nTable 6.1 Details of MoU signing\nYear MoU signed Year MoU signed\n1987-88 4 2012-13 196\n1991-92 72 2013-14 197\n2001-02 104 2014-15 214\n2002-03 100 2015-16 215\n2003-04 96 2016-17 231\n2004-05 99 2017-18 196\n2005-06 102 2018-19 165\n2006-07 113 2019-20 144\n2007-08 144 2020-21 124\n2008-09 147 2021-22 107\n2009-10 197 2022-23 88\n2010-11 198 2023-24 91\n2011-12 97 2024-25 90\n2025-26 86"

The parameters included in the revised MoU process are market\noriented, reflecting the shareholders' interest in terms of growth in revenue, EBITDA margin, return on net\nworth, return on capital employed, asset turnover ratio, and market capitalization. Adequate weightage has\nalso been given to production linked parameters pertaining to CPSE's core operations. All the parameters\nare quantifiable and verifiable from the documents in public domain. Besides, certain government's\npriorities/ programmes such as procurement from MSEs, CSR, etc. have also been included for compliance\nby CPSEs, the non-compliance of which would result in deduction of marks. The revised MoU framework\nalso provides for benchmarking based on growth and emerging trends of the sector, vision that has been\nworked by the Ministry about the sector, and peer performance.\n6.1.5 MoU Score and Rating : The CPSEs will be allotted marks proportionately for achievement of\ntarget figure for each parameter. Score on all parameters would be added to arrive at MoU score.

The objective of the policy is promotion and development of MSEs by supporting them in marketing\nof products & services. Some key points related to the policy include:\nI. With effect from FY 2012-13, every CPSE & Central Govt. Department should set an annual goal\nfor procurement from the MSE sector at the beginning of the year, with the objective of achieving an\noverall procurement goal of minimum 20% of total annual purchases of products produced &\nservices rendered by MSEs from the latter in a period of three years.\nII. Of the 20% target of annual procurement from MSEs, a sub-target of 4% must be earmarked for\nprocurement from MSEs owned by SC/ST entrepreneurs. However, in the event of failure of such\nMSEs to participate in the tender process or meet the tender requirements & the L1 price, the sub-\ntarget of 4% an be met from other MSEs.\nIII. At the end of three years (i.e., from FY 2015-16) the overall procurement goal of minimum 20% was\nmade mandatory. Non- conforming departments were required to provide reasons for the same to\nthe review committee set up under the policy."

In a tender, participating MSEs quoting price within the band of L1+15% may also be allowed to\nsupply a portion of the requirement by lowering their price to the L1 price in a situation where the L1\nprice is from someone other than an MSE. Such MSEs may be allowed to supply 20% of the total\ntendered value. In case of more than one such eligible MSE, the supply would be shared equally.\nThe Central Government amended the policy to increase the minimum annual procurement from MSEs\nfrom 20% to 25% and also mandated procuring minimum 3% out of the 25% from MSEs owned by women,\nin addition to 4% to be procured from MSEs owned by SC/ ST entrepreneurs. Further, to reduce transaction\ncost of doing business, MSEs were supported by providing tender sets free of cost and exempting them from\npayment of earnest money. These amendments were effected from April 1, 2019.\n199 CPSEs reported a total procurement from MSEs amounting to ₹98,064 crore during FY 2024-25, which\nshows an increase of 26.8% over previous year.\nCognate Group-wise Procurement from MSEs for FY 2024-25 is given in Table 7.3.

            "155 Public Enterprises Survey 2024-25\n7.3 Procurement through GeM\nGeM, hosted by Directorate General of Supplies & Disposals (DGS&D) is a paperless, cashless, & system-\ndriven e-market place that enables procurement of common-use goods & services with minimal human\ninterface. It is a dynamic, self-sustaining & user- friendly portal for procurement by offices of various\nGovernment Ministries & Departments, CPSEs & autonomous bodies of the Central Government.\nDGS&D developed GeM with technical support of National e-Governance Division (Ministry of\nElectronics & Information Technology). Intended benefits of the portal are listed below:\nI. Transparency: GeM eliminates human interface in vendor registration, order placement, &\npayment processing to a great extent. Being an open platform, it offers no entry barriers to bona fide\nsuppliers who wish to conduct business with the Government. At every step SMS & e-mail\nnotifications are sent to the buyers, the heads of their organisations, paying authorities & sellers.\nII. Efficiency: Direct purchase on GeM can be done within minutes and the entire process is online &\nend-to-end integrated with online tools for assessing price reasonability. For procurement of higher-\nvalue products & services, a transparent & efficient bidding / Reverse Auction (RA) facility is\navailable on GeM. For creating a bid / RA, buyers do not need to enter their own technical\nspecifications as they have been standardised on GeM. The bid / RA can be created expeditiously &\nfinalised within minimum of seven days.\nIII. Security & Safety: GeM is a secure platform & all the documents on the portal are e-signed at\nvarious stages by buyers & sellers. The antecedents of suppliers are verified online & automatically\nthrough MCA21, Aadhaar & PAN databases. Furthermore, third-party assessment of suppliers is\nconducted by Securities & Exchange Board of India-empanelled credit rating agencies.\nIV. Savings: The transparency, efficiency & ease of use of GeM has resulted in a substantial reduction in\nprices on the portal compared with the tender, rate contract & direct purchase rates. Average prices\non GeM are lower by at least 15-20% & insome cases even up to 56%. GeM also carries out demand\naggregation for items to be procured by various Central/State Government departments.\nV. Inclusivity in the Business Value Chain: Prosperity of the MSE sector is crucial for the growth of\nour country. The sector fuels the economy by providing employment & income to millions of people\nwho work for small, local businesses as well as in start-ups. GeM expects to improve the ease of\ndoing business for such small & medium enterprises and provide inclusivity by giving them a fair &\ntransparent platform to participate in business activities generated from Government sources.\nThe cognate group wise data showing total procurement, annual procurement through GeM & annual\nprocurement from MSEs through GeM during FY 2024-25 is summarised in Table 7.4."

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting is about disclosures by an organisation on non-\nfinancial parameters on aspects like ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and Business\nSustainability. In India, SEBI has introduced new reporting requirement called the Business Responsibility and\nSustainability Report (BRSR) applicable on select listed Companies based on Market Capitalisation. This also\ncovers few listed CPSEs based on Market Capitalisation. SEBI's BRSR format covers most of the ESG\nParameters. The BRSR disclosed by such CPSE for 2024-25 were collected. An attempt has been to collate the\nmetrics of such CPSEs on select parameters. As per information submitted by CPSEs in PE Survey 2024-25,\nthe BRSR is disclosed by 55 CPSEs (14 Maharatna CPSE, 23 Navratna CPSEs and 18 Other CPSEs). The\ninformation on Employee Training on various subject like Green House Gas Emissions, Stakeholder\nengagements & Complaints, Gender issues, Governance, Energy, Emission monitoring and Responsible Waste\nManagement have been considered as relevant for the collation and exhibited in this chapter in the forthcoming\nparagraphs and tables. The complete BRSR are available on the website of the respective CPSE. For few\nparameters, DPE has collected information (like CSR spending, gender bifurcation, social classification of\nemployees like SC, ST and OBC) from all CPSEs, irrespective of applicability of BRSR. Accordingly for other\nselected parameters all CPSEs are covered having such parameters.\n8.2 Coverage of CPSEs\nunder BRSR\n8.2.1 BRSR Format is primarily\ndivided into three sections. Section\nA covers General Disclosures;\nSection B covers Management and\nProcess Disclosures; Section C\nc o v e r s t h e P r i n c i p l e w i s e\nPerformance Disclosures.
